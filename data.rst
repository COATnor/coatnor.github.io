The COAT Data Portal is is based on FAIR and Open data principles.
In COAT we aim to publish all research data unless limited by either privacy or license restrictions.
This means that the majority of COAT data is distributed under the Creative Commons Public License (CC BY 4.0).
Our commitment to data access includes the provision of rich metadata both to guarantee data findability
and to enable data users to assess the content and significance of the data they download.
Together with data the portal will provide additional resources to better qualify and enrich the available data,
as well as links to the code required to reproduce the summary analyses, tables and plots,
stored in suitable code repositories.

Data Catalog
-------------------------------

The Data Portal is both a data catalog and a data sharing repository.
As a catalog it is built following FAIR guidelines
so that the datasets can be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable

Data can be searched from the graphical user interface, the portal's API
or metadata endpoints in different standards and exchange formats

At every dataset corresponds a metadata record and a landing page on the portal.
A dataset record in the catalog can be pointing to an external resource using a link (URL),
or include multiple files containing data or additional content as resources associated to the dataset.
