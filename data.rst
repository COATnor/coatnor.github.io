Data Catalog
-------------------------------

The Data Portal is both a data catalog and a data sharing repository.
As a catalog it is built following FAIR guidelines
so that the datasets can be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable

Data can be searched from the graphical user interface, the portal's API
or metadata endpoints in different standards and exchange formats

At every dataset corresponds a metadata record and a landing page on the portal.
A dataset record in the catalog can be pointing to an external resource using a link (URL),
or include multiple files containing data or additional content as resources associated to the dataset.
