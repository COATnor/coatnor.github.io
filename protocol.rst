* Fill the metadata
* The title should start with "\Protocol_\"
* Add a short description of the protocol. For example:
  *"Protocol for snowdepth measurements on the Varanger peninsula."*
* After filling the metadata, select Next: Add Data
* Upload the protocol PDF/A file, enter a filename and select "Save"
* After the upload is completed, the protocol can be set to 'Public' by
  selecting "Manage" in the protocol menu and setting 'Visibility' in metadata to 'Public'
